listingfile.py
by @hartmannhn
- used to produce list of files and folders in target directory to simplify searching process and manual file managing
- made with Python 3.7.4 (x64)
- learning recursive function, scandir, requesting input from user, output into txt file

future-update-plan
- add timer to display elapsed time
- add progressbar (if possible, since total workload is unknown due to recursive method)

v1.0
- now use recursive function without array list to facilitate unlimited directory depth and any number of files or folders
- now display list with indentation to show levels of directory
- now display input confirmation as a form of control to check if user input not conform to requested format
- uses user input for directory and filename to facilitate building into executable
